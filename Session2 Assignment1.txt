Question-Explain the Java Architecture.
Answer- Fist of all Java is a both compiled as well as interpreted language.
We first write the code known as source code.This source code is then compiled into bytecode during the time of compilation.
Now as we call Java as write once and run anywhere so now this byte code is interpreted by JVM or Java Virtual Machine.
JVM converts this bytecode into machine understandable code.This is all about Java Architecture.
